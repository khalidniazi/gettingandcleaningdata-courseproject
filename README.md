# gettingandcleaningdata-courseproject

This repository possesses an R script which cleans the Human activity Recognition by Smartphones data to make it Tidy and more iterpretable. the Repository includes four files (run_analysis.R, README.md, CodeBook.md, TidyData.txt). the original source of Data is UCI repository. link is given below:

## Steps Involved in Project Completion
1. Download the dataset.
2. Read the Training and Testing Data into R; also read the Features and activity information into R
3. Merge the Training and testing Data after assigning the Labels to columns.
4. Reduce the Dataset to contain only those columns which provide Standar Deviation and Mean information.
5. Clean the Feature Names to be more descriptive and explainatory.
7. Finally create a Tidy Dataset containing the mean value grouped by activity and subject.
8. This Data is then exported to a file 'TidyData.txt'
